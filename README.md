# The Dataset
The Student_Performance_Dataset was downloaded from Open ML. Dataset Source Link: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=46255
# The Project
This project is part of my ANA500: Python for Data Science course at National University. 
## Problem Statement
The academic performance of high school students has lifelong financial, social, and psychological impacts. With that in mind, this project aims to identify which factors have the greatest impact in predicting student performance through the analysis of the Student_Performance_Dataset from OpenML. By creating an algorithm that classifies whether a student is “at-risk” academically, at-risk populations can be proactively recognized and targeted intervention strategies can be developed to increase overall student achievement levels. 
## Hypothesis
Among the 13 independent variables present in the dataset, I hypothesize that study time, absences, tutoring, and parental support will have the largest effect on student performance.
